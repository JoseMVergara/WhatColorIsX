About
=====

WhatColorIsX was initially developed to replace the boring task of manually
assigning colours to objects on another project. The values it returns are
generally more relevant than a randomly generated colour - although it throws up
some surprises sometimes!

Useage can be as simple as ``whatcoloris string`` from the command-line; see the
:ref:`examples` section for more options.

Thanks to Valentine Lab for the `colour`_ module, which is super easy to use and
partly inspired this module. If you need to post-process the output of WhatColorIsX,
I highly recommend giving it a look for it's lightweight simplicity.

And as always, thanks to all the contributors of `Pillow`_, for their hard work.
