About
=====

WhatColorIsX is a simple python module that aims to answer one question well -
what colour is this string? Useful for automating colour generation for multiple
items, WhatColorIsX can also be used to examine local files.

Useage can be as simple as ``whatcoloris string`` from the command-line; see the
:ref:`examples` section for more options.

Thanks to Valentine Lab for the `colour`_ module, which is super easy to use and
partly inspired this module.
